      Our Nap,<br/>
      Who art in bed,<br/>
      hallowed be Thy rest;<br/>
      Thy sleep will come;<br/>
      Thy doze be done on ground as it is in bed.<br/>
      Give us this day our daily REM;<br/>
      and forgive us our awakes<br/>
      as we forgive those who awoke against us;<br/>
      and lead us not into arousal,<br/>
      but deliver us from caffiene. Anap.
